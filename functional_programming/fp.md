![RC](high.png)
> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm 
> where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. 
> It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees 
> of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of 
> imperative statements which update the running state of the program.
